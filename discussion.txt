Milestone P2, due 23:59 CET, 17 Nov 2023 (20% of the project): 
To be done as a team, where the team submits a GitHub repository that includes: 
(1) a well-organized README containing the detailed project proposal (up to 1000 words) and 
(2) a notebook containing initial analyses and data handling pipelines. We will grade the correctness, 
quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions.

When you are done with Homework H1, you will continue to work on the next project milestone. In Milestone P2, 
together with your team members, you will agree on and refine your project proposal. Your first task is to 
select a project. Even though we provide the datasets for you to use, at this juncture, it is your responsibility 
to perform initial analyses and verify that what you propose is feasible given the data (including any additional 
data you might bring in yourself), which is crucial for the success of the project.

The goal of this milestone is to intimately acquaint yourself with the data, preprocess it, 
and complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks. We expect you to have a pipeline 
in place, fully documented in a notebook, and show us that you have clear project goals.

When describing the relevant aspects of the data, and any other datasets you may intend to use, 
you should in particular show (non-exhaustive list):

That you can handle the data in its size.
That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices 
that you considered but dropped.
We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and 
its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, 
reasonable, and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order 
with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone P3! There will be project office hours dedicated 
to helping you.

You will work in a public GitHub repository dedicated to your project, which can be created by following this link. 
The repository will automatically be named ada-2023-project-<your_team_name>. By the Milestone P2 deadline, each team should
have a single public GitHub repo under the epfl-ada GitHub organization, containing the project proposal and initial analysis code.
